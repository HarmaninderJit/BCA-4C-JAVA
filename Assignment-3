In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as 
they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain
condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as
the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ValidNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int count = 0;

        System.out.println("Enter numbers. Enter a non-divisible-by-8 number to stop.");

        while (true) {
            System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
            int number = scanner.nextInt();

            if (number % 8 == 0) {
                count++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Number of valid numbers entered: " + count);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
