The policy followed by a company to process customer orders is given by the following rules:
•	If a customer order is less than or equal to that in stock and has credit is OK, supply has requirement.
•	If the credit is not OK do not supply. Send him intimation.
•	If the credit is Ok but the item in stock is less than the order, supply what is in stock. Intimate to him the balance will be shipped.
Write a Java program to implement the company policy.

import java.util.Scanner;

class CustomerOrder {
    private int stock;
    private boolean creditOk;

    public CustomerOrder(int stock, boolean creditOk) {
        this.stock = stock;
        this.creditOk = creditOk;
    }

    public void processOrder(int order) {
        if (order <= stock && creditOk) {
            System.out.println("Supply " + order + " units as per the order.");
        } else if (!creditOk) {
            System.out.println("Credit is not OK. Cannot supply.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Supply " + stock + " units as per the stock available.");
            int balance = order - stock;
            System.out.println("Intimate to the customer that " + balance + " units will be shipped later.");
        }
    }
}

public class CompanyPolicy {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the stock available: ");
        int stock = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Is the credit OK? (true/false): ");
        boolean creditOk = scanner.nextBoolean();

        System.out.print("Enter the customer order: ");
        int order = scanner.nextInt();

        CustomerOrder customerOrder = new CustomerOrder(stock, creditOk);
        customerOrder.processOrder(order);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
